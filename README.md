## What is a Database?

In the context of computing, a **database** is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are designed to manage large volumes of data efficiently and provide mechanisms for storing, retrieving, modifying, and deleting data. They serve as a central repository for information that can be accessed by various applications or users.

### Types of Databases

1. **Relational Databases**: Organize data into tables with predefined relationships between them. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server, and SQLite.

2. **NoSQL Databases**: Designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and provide flexible schema options. Examples include MongoDB, Couchbase, Cassandra, and Redis.

3. **Data Warehouses**: Used for storing and analyzing large volumes of historical data from various sources. Examples include Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake.

4. **Graph Databases**: Optimize for representing and querying graph-like structures, making them suitable for applications like social networks, recommendation systems, and network analysis. Examples include Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, and JanusGraph.

5. **Time-Series Databases**: Specialized for handling time-series data, such as metrics, sensor data, and log data. Examples include InfluxDB, Prometheus, and TimescaleDB.

6. **Document Databases**: Store and retrieve document-based data formats like JSON, XML, or BSON. Examples include MongoDB, Couchbase, and Elasticsearch.
